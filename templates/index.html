        <h2>Intro</h2>
        
        <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n Our Place we always try to bring to you the best reviews and datas for the Drones, in other words quadcopters that are in the Market right now. Drone is a huge step toward futuristic world. Although there are many ongoing debates about how drones are contributing to civil privacy and so on and so forth, there are until this moment so many good applications of drones or the little quadcopters on your hand which we can safely say discount the misuse atleast to some degree. As it is still on it's early stage, there are lots of developments needs to be done and happening each and every day.</p>
        
        <h2>History</h2>
        
        <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he drone technology is nothing new though. It is believed that the first drone development dates back as early as World War 1. In military the term "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" or UAV is widely used for drones. Of course many people still have a misconception about Drones, that it is "Somewhat a scary military component". Which of course is not true. The Methodlogy is Aerial Vehicle which can be controlled remotely via satelitle or radio signal, or being more appropriate without direct human input. During the Vietnam War the US, revolutionized it's drone program to a whole new level. Sophisticated program's like U2 and Ryan was ushered in that era by US Air Force. </p>
        
        <h2>Modern Era</h2>
        
        <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hile many considers the significance and attitude towards Drones, really started to take shape during the 1982 Israel-Syrian Conflict, I disagree and think the real significance were the creation of Predator Drones. The Predator MQ1 was first deployed to the Balkans in 1995 Iraq in 1996 and was proved very effective in Operation Iraqi Freedom as well as Afghanistan.Another growth field in UAVs are miniature UAVs, ranging from "micro air vehicles (MAVs)" that can be carried by an infantryman to man-portable UAVs that can be carried and launched like an infantry anti-aircraft missile.The idea of designing a UAV that could remain in the air for a long time has been around for decades, but only became an operational reality in the 21st century. Endurance UAVs for low-altitude and high-altitude operation, the latter sometimes referred to as "high-altitude long-endurance (HALE)" UAVs, are now in full service.On August 21, 1998, an Insitu Aerosonde named Laima becomes the first UAV to cross the Atlantic Ocean, completing the flight in 26 hours.</p>
        
        <h2>Micro UAV</h2>
        
        <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n the Modern era, specially after the revolution of Smartphone technology with Google Android back in 2008, these types of Drones have become increasingly popular and an ever growing field. These are also called Quadcopters and this is what we gonna talk and focus about. These can also be called as general purpose consumer drone. These types of drones are solely design for fun and entertainment. But, as the features are very sophisticated and technlogy is developing rapidly in this field, the applications of Micro UAV's in our domestic or work place in increasing. From TV Stations to Wedding Party, a lot of people now using drones for capturing those moments or live broadcast via the interlink. These drones were proven extremely handy specially in the Nepal Earthquake earlier this year. International Red-Cross and lots of others charity organization and volunteers have used drones to track and pass temporary aids to victims, which contained the damage in a significant degree.</p>
